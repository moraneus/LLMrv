# LLMrv
LLMrv is a framework for monitoring LLM conversations against formal safety policies in real time. It models conversations as event traces, specifies policies in past-time temporal logic (ptLTL), and bridges the gap between formal Boolean semantics and free-form natural language through a semantic grounding layer.
